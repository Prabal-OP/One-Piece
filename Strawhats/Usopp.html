    <h1>Usopp</h1>
    <p>
      "God" Usopp[9] is the sniper of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the
      Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the fourth member
      of the crew and the third to join, doing so at the end of the Syrup
      Village Arc. Although he left the crew during the Water 7 Arc, he rejoined
      at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[15] ><br />Usopp is the son of
      Yasopp and Banchina. He was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as
      "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After
      working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he
      was invited to join the crew. Despite his usual cowardice, Usopp dreams of
      becoming a brave warrior of the sea just like his father and lives every
      day in pursuit of living up to this dream.
