    <h1>Brook</h1>
    <p>
      "Soul King" Brook[10] is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
      their two swordsmen and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
      Fleet.[3] He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join,[15]
      doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.

      <br />Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life
      after death once.[16] Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the
      powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own
      soul and the souls of others.

      <br />Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was
      resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the
      amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a
      skeleton, keeping only his afro intact.[16] Brook drifted alone in the
      Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the
      Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining
      the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse
      Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
