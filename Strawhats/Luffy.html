    <h1>Luffy</h1>
    <p>
      Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw
      Hat",[11] is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is
      the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw
      Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[27] He
      desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D.
      Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate
      an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers and
      crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most
      freedom in the world.[31]

      <br />Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of Monkey D. Dragon, the
      leader of the Revolutionary Army,[32] and the grandson of the Marine hero
      Monkey D. Garp,[33] and their family carries the initial and Will of
      D.[32] Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave Luffy the very straw hat
      that has become Luffy's signature accessory, having gifted it to the boy
      as part of a promise for them to meet again someday after he became a
      great pirate.[34] Growing up on Dawn Island, Luffy befriended and became
      sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas D. Ace[35] and
      Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo,[36] as well as being raised under the
      care of Curly Dadan.[37]

      <br />Luffy accidentally ate the Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned
      his body into rubber.[38] Thanks to his strong imagination, Luffy is able
      to wield the seemingly unthreatening abilities of his Devil Fruit to act
      as an incredibly competent fighter, often manipulating his own rubbery
      body into a variety of powerful forms. He is one of few individuals known
      to have awakened his Devil Fruit, which bestows him with mythical
      power.[26] In addition to his Devil Fruit abilities, Luffy is one of few
      individuals capable of wielding all three forms of Haki and has mastered
      them to the point that he has developed advanced abilities.

      <br />Luffy has gone up against numerous global powers around him,
      starting with fighting the most powerful pirates in the East Blue and
      moving to clashes against the Marines, Seven Warlords of the Sea, Cipher
      Pol, World Nobles, and even the Four Emperors of the Grand Line, emerging
      victorious in a majority of these battles. He invaded and indirectly
      caused the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaped the impregnable Impel
      Down, and was a focal figure in the Summit War of Marineford. He has also
      either defeated or befriended seven of the eleven known past or present
      Warlords prior to the organization's dissolution. Furthermore, Luffy has
      invaded the territory of the Four Emperors on multiple occasions, and
      eventually managed to defeat one. Luffy's accomplishments and heritage
      have caused him to be labeled as a "Dangerous Future Element" while in the
      process gaining a reputation for being "reckless" and, in some cases,
      "insane," earning the wrath of Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, the Marine
      Headquarters, and even the World Government.[39]

      <br />Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has
      unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet, consisting
      of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes.
      After learning of this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the
      press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea," though many prominent
      figures initially considered this to be exaggerated.[40] However, after
      defeating Kaidou during the Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially
      declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government along with
      Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.[41]
