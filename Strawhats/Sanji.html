    <h1>Sanji</h1>
    <p>
      "Black Leg" Sanji,[12] born as Vinsmoke Sanji,[22][23][24] is the cook of
      the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat
      Grand Fleet.[5] He is the fifth member of the crew and the fourth to join,
      doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.<br />Born as the third son and
      fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[25] (Thus, making him a former prince
      of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and
      again after reuniting with them as an adult.[26] After fleeing the
      Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous
      chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy,
      who convinced him to join his crew.<br />His dream is to find the rumored
      chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North
      Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top
      three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.[27][28]
