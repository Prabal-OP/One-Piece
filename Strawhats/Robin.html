    <h1>Nico robin</h1>
    <p>
      Nico Robin,[15] also known by her epithet "Devil Child"[7] and the "Light
      of the Revolution",[8] is the archaeologist of the Straw Hat Pirates and
      one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] She is the
      seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of
      the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but
      rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.

      <br />Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power
      to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will.
      As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is
      currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to
      read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and
      threatening to the World Government.

      <br />She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All
      Sunday",[1] serving and partnering herself directly with the
      organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under
      the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga,
      before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph
      which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.
