    <h1>Jinbe</h1>
    <p>
      "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe[1] is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and
      one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] He is the
      tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano
      Country Arc.[18]

      <br />Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man
      Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying
      wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a
      member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after
      the death of their original captain, Tiger.[9] He eventually became one of
      the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of
      Marineford.[5][9]

      <br />Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and
      two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man
      Pirates' coup d'Ã©tat against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family.
      Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held
      it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island
      Arc.[19] After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates
      from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano
      Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.
