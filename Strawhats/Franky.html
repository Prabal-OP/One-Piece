    <h1>Franky</h1>
    <p>
      "Iron Man" Franky[7] is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of
      the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] He is the crew's
      eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the
      Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[18]

      <br />Born "Cutty Flam",[19] he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky"
      until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of
      Iceburg to hide his identity.[20] Originally from the South Blue,[21]
      Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making
      his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until
      an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him
      to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the
      leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty
      hunters.[2]

      <br />Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats
      at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to
      become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's
      dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he
      built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his
      dream.
