    <h1>Zoro</h1>
    <p>
      Roronoa Zoro,[19] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[8] is the combatant
      of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior
      Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[3] and is publicly recognized as
      the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[20][21] Formerly
      a bounty hunter,[5] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first
      to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]<br />As a master of Three
      Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood
      training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful
      combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji.[22][23] His dream
      is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a
      promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[24]<br />In
      addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty
      hunter, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to
      as the "Worst Generation".[25]
