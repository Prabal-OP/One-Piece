    <h1>Strawhat Pirates</h1>
    <h3>1. Luffy</h3>
    <p>
      Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw
      Hat",[11] is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One Piece. He is
      the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw
      Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[27] He
      desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D.
      Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate
      an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers and
      crew.[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most
      freedom in the world.[31]<br />Born in Foosha Village, Luffy is the son of
      Monkey D. Dragon, the leader of the Revolutionary Army,[32] and the
      grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp,[33] and their family carries
      the initial and Will of D.[32] Luffy met "Red-Haired" Shanks, who gave
      Luffy the very straw hat that has become Luffy's signature accessory,
      having gifted it to the boy as part of a promise for them to meet again
      someday after he became a great pirate.[34] Growing up on Dawn Island,
      Luffy befriended and became sworn brothers of the late "Fire Fist" Portgas
      D. Ace[35] and Revolutionary Chief-of-Staff Sabo,[36] as well as being
      raised under the care of Curly Dadan.[37]<br />Luffy accidentally ate the
      Gomu Gomu no Mi at age 7, which turned his body into rubber.[38] Thanks to
      his strong imagination, Luffy is able to wield the seemingly unthreatening
      abilities of his Devil Fruit to act as an incredibly competent fighter,
      often manipulating his own rubbery body into a variety of powerful forms.
      He is one of few individuals known to have awakened his Devil Fruit, which
      bestows him with mythical power.[26] In addition to his Devil Fruit
      abilities, Luffy is one of few individuals capable of wielding all three
      forms of Haki and has mastered them to the point that he has developed
      advanced abilities.<br />

    <h3>2. Zoro</h3>
    <p>
      Roronoa Zoro,[19] also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro,[8] is the combatant
      of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their two swordsmen, one of the Senior
      Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet,[3] and is publicly recognized as
      the right-hand man of his crew's captain Monkey D. Luffy.[20][21] Formerly
      a bounty hunter,[5] he is the second member of Luffy's crew and the first
      to join it, doing so in the Romance Dawn Arc.[2]<br />As a master of Three
      Sword Style, a swordsmanship style which he created during his childhood
      training in Shimotsuki Village, Zoro is among the three most powerful
      combatants of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Sanji.[22][23] His dream
      is to become the greatest swordsman in the world, in order to honor a
      promise he made to his deceased childhood friend Kuina.[24]<br />In
      addition to his infamy as one of the Straw Hats and as a former bounty
      hunter, Zoro is also regarded as one of twelve pirates who are referred to
      as the "Worst Generation".[25]

      doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc.<br />Born as the third son and
      fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family[25] (Thus, making him a former prince
      of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice, once in his youth and
      again after reuniting with them as an adult.[26] After fleeing the
      Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the care of Zeff as the sous
      chef of the Baratie, where he would remain until he met Monkey D. Luffy,
      who convinced him to join his crew.<br />His dream is to find the rumored
      chef's paradise, All Blue, which is where East Blue, West Blue, North
      Blue, and South Blue meet, along with their wildlife. He is one of the top
      three fighters of the Straw Hats, alongside Luffy and Zoro.[27][28]

      As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is
      currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to

    <h3>7. Franky</h3>
    <p>

      the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] He is the crew's
      eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the
      Post-Enies Lobby Arc.[18]

      <br />Born "Cutty Flam",[19] he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky"
      until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of
      Iceburg to hide his identity.[20] Originally from the South Blue,[21]
      Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making
      his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until
      an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him
      to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the
      leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty
      hunters.[2]

      <br />Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats
      at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to
      become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's
      dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he
      built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his
      dream.

    <h3>8. Chopper</h3>
    <p>
      Tony Tony Chopper, also known as "Cotton Candy Lover" Chopper,[7] is the
      doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the
      Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[2] He is the sixth member of the crew and the fifth

      forced to join the Foxy Pirates during the Long Ring Long Land Arc, but
      was quickly returned to Luffy's crew.

      <br />Chopper is a reindeer that ate the Hito Hito no Mi, a Devil Fruit
      that allows its user to transform into a human hybrid or a human at will.
      He came from Drum Island and was taught how to be a doctor by his two
      parental figures, Doctors Hiriluk and Kureha. His dream is to one day

    <h3>9. Brook</h3>
    <p>
      "Soul King" Brook[10] is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of
      their two swordsmen and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
      Fleet.[3] He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join,[15]
      doing so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc.

      <br />Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life
      after death once.[16] Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the
      powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own
      soul and the souls of others.

      <br />Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was
      resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the
      amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a
      skeleton, keeping only his afro intact.[16] Brook drifted alone in the
      Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the
      Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining
      the crew. His dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse
      Mountain, where he resides with Crocus.
    </p>
    <h3>10. Jimbei</h3>
    <p>
      "Knight of the Sea" Jinbe[1] is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and
      one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet.[3] He is the
      tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano
      Country Arc.[18]

      <br />Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man
      Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying
      wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a
      member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after
      the death of their original captain, Tiger.[9] He eventually became one of
      the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of
      Marineford.[5][9]

      <br />Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and
      two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man
      Pirates' coup d'√©tat against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family.
      Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held
      it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island
      Arc.[19] After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates
      from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano
      Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.
    </p>
    <h3>11. Going Merry</h3>
    <p>
      The Going Merry was the first full-sized ship owned by the Straw Hat
      Pirates, a caravel that served as their main transportation through the
      East Blue, and the Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally
      referred to as simply Merry („É°„É™„Éº Merƒ´?) by the crew.

      <br />Originally designed by Kaya's servant Merry, it was gifted to the
      Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over
      time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much
      so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine
      crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of
      damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple
      times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer
      continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received
      a Viking funeral.[4]

      <br />After its destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the Thousand
      Sunny, a ship specially built by Franky (and the Galley-La Company) to
      maintain the "soul" of its predecessor.[5]

    <h2>Honorary Strawhats</h2>
    <h3># Vivi</h3>
    <p>
      Nefertari Vivi[8] is the princess of the Arabasta Kingdom.[2] She is the
      daughter of Nefertari Cobra and Titi. During her childhood, Vivi was part
      of the Suna Suna Clan, being the vice-leader of the group led by her
      friend Koza.

      <br />Vivi debuted as one of the main antagonists of the Reverse Mountain
      Arc as a Bounty Hunter, under the Baroque Works codename Miss
      Wednesday.[1] During this time, she was partnered with fellow Frontier
      Agent, Mr. 9. However, after the events of the Whisky Peak Arc, Vivi and
      her pet Karoo ended up joining the Straw Hat Pirates for most of the
      Arabasta Saga once she was discovered to be a spy plotting against Baroque
      Works.

      <br />Vivi left the Straw Hats after defeating Baroque Works to stay in
      her home country, but is still considered a member of the crew and has
      been keeping track of their progress throughout the series.[9] She also
      has a major role in the Levely Arc, as her father's companion. Around the
      end of the Wano Country Arc, following the supposed assassination of her
      father, Vivi was reported as being missing.[10]

      agent of Baroque Works and an okama.[8][3] He was a major antagonist
      during the Arabasta Arc, and (along with his fellow Officer Agents) one of
      the central characters in Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque
      Works".

      <br />While he was once an enemy of Luffy's as a member of Baroque
      Works,[9] the two became quick friends, leading Bon Kurei to sacrifice
      himself for Luffy both at Arabasta[10] and later at Impel Down[11], being
      one of his main allies during that Story Arc. He is currently the new
      queen of Newkama Land.[2]
