    <h1>Thousand Sunny</h1>
    <p>
      The Thousand Sunny is the second ship of the Straw Hat Pirates, built
      after the Going Merry was destroyed. It is often referred to as Sunny
      (サニー Sanī?) by the crew. It is a brigantine-type ship designed and
      built by Franky with help from Yokozuna, Iceburg, and the remaining
      Galley-La foremen who were among the best shipwrights in the world.[1]
      Built from Adam Wood, it is a magnificent ship of the finest craftsmanship
      at least double the size of the Going Merry. Its features include
      practically all of the various requests the Straw Hats had before arriving
      in Water 7.
