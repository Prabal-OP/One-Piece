    <h1>Going Merry</h1>
    <p>
      The Going Merry was the first full-sized ship owned by the Straw Hat
      Pirates, a caravel that served as their main transportation through the
      East Blue, and the Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally
      referred to as simply Merry (メリー Merī?) by the crew.

      <br />Originally designed by Kaya's servant Merry, it was gifted to the
      Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over
      time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much
      so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine
      crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of
      damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple
      times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer
      continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received
      a Viking funeral.[4]

      <br />After its destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the Thousand
      Sunny, a ship specially built by Franky (and the Galley-La Company) to
      maintain the "soul" of its predecessor.[5]
