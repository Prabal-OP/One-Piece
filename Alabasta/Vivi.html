    <h1>Vivi</h1>
    <p>
      Nefertari Vivi[8] is the princess of the Arabasta Kingdom.[2] She is the
      daughter of Nefertari Cobra and Titi. During her childhood, Vivi was part
      of the Suna Suna Clan, being the vice-leader of the group led by her
      friend Koza.

      <br />Vivi debuted as one of the main antagonists of the Reverse Mountain
      Arc as a Bounty Hunter, under the Baroque Works codename Miss
      Wednesday.[1] During this time, she was partnered with fellow Frontier
      Agent, Mr. 9. However, after the events of the Whisky Peak Arc, Vivi and
      her pet Karoo ended up joining the Straw Hat Pirates for most of the
      Arabasta Saga once she was discovered to be a spy plotting against Baroque
      Works.

      <br />Vivi left the Straw Hats after defeating Baroque Works to stay in
      her home country, but is still considered a member of the crew and has
      been keeping track of their progress throughout the series.[9] She also
      has a major role in the Levely Arc, as her father's companion. Around the
      end of the Wano Country Arc, following the supposed assassination of her
      father, Vivi was reported as being missing.[10]
