    <h1>Bon-chan</h1>
    <p>
      Bentham of the Wild, alias Mr. 2 Bon Kurei,[7][4] is a former officer
      agent of Baroque Works and an okama.[8][3] He was a major antagonist
      during the Arabasta Arc, and (along with his fellow Officer Agents) one of
      the central characters in Miss Goldenweek's "Operation: Meet Baroque
      Works".

      <br />While he was once an enemy of Luffy's as a member of Baroque
      Works,[9] the two became quick friends, leading Bon Kurei to sacrifice
      himself for Luffy both at Arabasta[10] and later at Impel Down[11], being
      one of his main allies during that Story Arc. He is currently the new
      queen of Newkama Land.[2]
